# AndroidStateManagement
Managing states in android can be quite a task when not carefully approached.So many problems can occur due to poor state management,for example: poor failure handling, code becomes hard to read and multiple responsibilities for simple use cases. With Kotlin, we have Sealed classes to our rescue.  Sealed Classes are useful when modeling stateâ€™s within various app workflows. In this workshop we'll be looking at how to leverage the power of Kotlin Sealed Classes .This repository shows what Sealed Classes are, how they work and how you can use sealed classes to mange states in  android applications.
